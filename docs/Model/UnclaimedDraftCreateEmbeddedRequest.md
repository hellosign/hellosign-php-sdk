When using Text Tags it is preferred that you set this to `false` and hide your tags with white text or something similar because the automatic removal system can cause unwanted clipping. See the [Text Tags](https://app.hellosign.com/api/textTagsWalkthrough#TextTagIntro) walkthrough for more details.  |  [default to false] |

For example, use the metadata field to store a signer&#39;s order number for look up when receiving events for the signature request.<br><br>Each request can include up to 10 metadata keys (or 50 nested metadata keys), with key names up to 40 characters long and values up to 1000 characters long.  |  |
| `requesting_redirect_url` | ```string``` |  The URL you want signers redirected to after they successfully request a signature.  |  |

| `show_progress_stepper` | ```bool``` |  When only one step remains in the signature request process and this parameter is set to `false` then the progress stepper will be hidden.  |  [default to true] |

| `type` | ```string``` |  The type of the draft. By default this is `request_signature`, but you can set it to `send_document` if you want to self sign a document and download it.  |  [default to 'request_signature'] |
| `use_preexisting_fields` | ```bool``` |  Set `use_text_tags` to `true` to enable [Text Tags](https://app.hellosign.com/api/textTagsWalkthrough#TextTagIntro) parsing in your document (defaults to disabled, or `false`). Alternatively, if your PDF contains pre-defined fields, enable the detection of these fields by setting the `use_preexisting_fields` to `true` (defaults to disabled, or `false`). Currently we only support use of either `use_text_tags` or `use_preexisting_fields` parameter, not both.  |  [default to false] |
| `use_text_tags` | ```bool``` |  Set `use_text_tags` to `true` to enable [Text Tags](https://app.hellosign.com/api/textTagsWalkthrough#TextTagIntro) parsing in your document (defaults to disabled, or `false`). Alternatively, if your PDF contains pre-defined fields, enable the detection of these fields by setting the `use_preexisting_fields` to `true` (defaults to disabled, or `false`).

| `populate_auto_fill_fields` | ```bool``` |  Controls whether [auto fill fields](https://faq.hellosign.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051467511-Auto-Fill-Fields) can automatically populate a signer&#39;s information during signing.<br><br>⚠️ **Note** ⚠️: Keep your signer&#39;s information safe by ensuring that the _signer on your signature request is the intended party_ before using this feature.  |  [default to false] |
| `expires_at` | ```int``` |  When the signature request will expire. Unsigned signatures will be moved to the expired status, and no longer signable.<br><br>**Note** This does not correspond to the **expires_at** returned in the response.  |  |
